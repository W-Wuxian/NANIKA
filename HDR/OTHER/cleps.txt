Launching jobs

CLEPS uses Slurm, a job scheduling system for Linux clusters. You must use it to submit and control jobs. It acts a workload manager by allocating required resources at the right time to run your jobs. This page will provide you with information on job submission in both interactive and batch modes.

Commands used to manage and interact with your jobs are located in the Job management section.
Slurm terminology

Depending on node configuration, a cpu can be either a core or a thread. On nodes where hyperthreading is activated (see CLEPS Compute nodes), a cpu is a thread. Otherwise it is a core.

On CLEPS, the smallest allocatable consumable resource is a core, meaning that if you ask Slurm for a single cpu on a node with hyperthreading activated, you will get a whole core allocated but your task will run on a single thread on this core. This configuration ensures that no other user will use the other thread, limiting interferences with other users jobs.
